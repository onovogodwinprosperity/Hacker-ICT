# Explanation of steps the above Code is writen and strutured

The HTML code you provided represents a web page layout with various sections and elements. Here's a breakdown of the HTML structure and an explanation of the corresponding CSS syntax:

The HTML starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and the opening <html> tag. The lang attribute is set to "en" for English.

The <head> section contains metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings, page title, and CSS and JavaScript dependencies. It includes a link to an external CSS file (style.css) and a script tag for the Font Awesome library.

The <body> section represents the main content of the web page. It starts with a <nav> element for the navigation bar, containing a logo, notification, inbox, and video icons.

Inside the <nav> element, there is a search box represented by the <div> with the class search-box. It includes an image and an input field for searching.

Next, there is a user icon represented by the <div> with the class nav-user-icon. It includes an image for the user's profile picture.

Following the navigation bar, there is a settings menu represented by the <div> with the class settings-menu. The settings menu contains various settings options and links.

After the navigation section, there is a <div> with the class container. This div contains the main content of the web page and is divided into three sections: left-sidebar, main-content, and right-sidebar.

The left-sidebar contains important links, shortcut links, and other sidebar elements.

The main-content section contains a story gallery with story elements represented by the <div> with the class story. It also includes a write-post container, post containers, and a load-more button.

The right-sidebar contains event listings, advertisements, and an online chat list.

Finally, there is a footer section at the bottom of the page with copyright information.

The CSS syntax provided in your code is used to style various elements in the HTML. It defines CSS rules for different classes and selectors to control the layout, colors, font styles, and transitions of the web page.

For example, you can see CSS rules for setting the background color, font family, margins, paddings, and other styles for different elements and classes. There are also specific rules for styling the navigation bar, search box, user icons, story gallery, post containers, and settings menu.

To apply the provided CSS to the HTML, save the CSS code in a separate file named style.css and link it in the HTML file using the <link> tag, as shown in your original HTML code.
